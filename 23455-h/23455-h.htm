<p>That model Miss, Jemima Jane</p>
<p>Was very good, and very plain;</p>
<p>Her parents noticed with delight</p>
<p>How neat she was, and how polite.</p>
<p>Sometimes her young companions came</p>
<p>And begged she’d join them in a game.</p>
<p>But it was never any use;</p>
<p>She’d make some civil, quiet excuse,</p>
<p>And, “Dear Mama,” she’d whisp’ring say,</p>
<p>“I love plain sewing more than play;</p>
<p>I hope you’ll always think of me</p>
<p>As your own gentle, busy Bee!”</p>
<p>Jane rose at five. “What for?” you ask;</p>
<p>And I reply, “To con her task.”</p>
<p>She breakfasted on milk and bread,</p>
<p>Nor ever asked for aught instead;</p>
<p>“I like it best, because,” said she,</p>
<p>“’Tis wholesome for a child like me.”</p>
<p>She used to think it quite a treat,</p>
<p>To put her bed and chamber neat;</p>
<p>But she enjoyed&mdash;oh, better far!</p>
<p>Saying her tasks to her Mama.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<!-- png 009 -->

<p>She took the air when these were done,</p>
<p>But she would never romp and run;</p>
<p>Prim and sedate she walked about,</p>
<p>Her back quite straight, her toes turned out:</p>
<p>And all the people, seeing this,</p>
<p>Exclaimed, “Oh, what a model Miss!”</p>

<p>Now that Ann’s Aunt was left in peace</p>
<p>She made excuses for her niece;</p>
<p>If she were noisy at her play,</p>
<p>She said, “I like to see her gay.”</p>

<p>She only shook her head and smiled.</p>
